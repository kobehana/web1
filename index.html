  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information syste
    m where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Lo
    cators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperl
    inks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are t
    ransferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users b
    y a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software applic
    ation called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, whic
    h pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web
    is built.</p>
